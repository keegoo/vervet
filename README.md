# Road Map

  - `vervet.py` is going to be a system(CPU/MEM/Network/Process) monitoring tool running in local.
  - `vervet.py` will running in one of two modes: 1). standalone mode or 2). server mode.
  - In standalone mode, `vervet.py` will records system data locally. 
  - In server mode, `vervet.py` will post the data to a remote server(this remote server will be accomplished in another repo.).
  - `vervet.py` will be configurable at runtime in both modes.
  - `vervet.py` will be a single file python scripts for easy distribution.
  - `vervet.py` will be easy to use and robust.
  - should support both Linux and Windows.
